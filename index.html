                    <img src="/assets/images/Capstone-1.png" alt="Project 1">
                    <p>For my engineering capstone project at the University of Victoria, my group and I were tasked with designing a custom sanding machine for JSF Coatings, a local 
                        powder coat shop. The machine was designed to remove powder coat overspray from steel hanging rods.</p>
                    <div class="project-details">
                        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">The hanger rods need to maintain surface conductivity, so that parts hanging from them can be electrically grounded, to electrostatically attract the paint. However, when the rods get covered in paint and cured in the oven, this surface conductivity is lost, and the paint must be removed by hand, which is an unpopular task on the shop floor.</p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Our machine automated this task, allowing operators to place painted rods in the machine, press a button, walk away, and return to a fully cleaned rod.</p>
                        <p><strong>My Responsibilities:</strong></p>

                            <img src="/assets/images/Capstone-2.png" alt="Project 2">
                            <p>I designed this test jig to verify that the angled idler would convert rotation to axial translation</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>3D printed pillow blocks secure the bearings for the rollers, and a 3D printed adjustable roller assembly allows the angle of the idler to be calibrated. </li>
                                <li>Parallel powered rollers cause the bar to spin, and the angled idler roller applies pressure from above, exerting an axial force to allow translation.</li>
                                <li>The bottom rollers were designed to have less grip, to promote slipping along the parallel rollers while the top roller has more grip, to facilitate translation.</li>
                                <li>In this  test jig, the parallel rollers were powered by a cordless drill, and a handheld belt sander simulated the forces from the sander</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This testing jig allowed us to verify the concept, and estimate how much downward force was required from the top roller to facilitate axial 
                                sliding without seizing.

                                <p>This was my final design for the angled idler assembly.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The whole assembly can slide up and down along the two shoulder bolts, which locate the springs, supplying the required downwards force on the bar.</li>
                                    <li>Smooth sliding is ensured by the two brass bushings in the top square bar.</li>
                                    <li>To simplify machining requirements A shoulder bolt is used as the roller shaft, locating two bearings with 3D printed spacers.</li>

                                <p>To ensure that the angled idler supplies sufficient downwards force to facilitate axial translation, I conducted spring stiffness and pre-tension calculations</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Empirical testing showed that ~15lbs of force was required to facilitate translation.</li>
                                    <li>Spring pre-tension, and buttom-out position were calculated, and a spring stiffness and length were selected to supply 15lbs-20lbs for rods over a range of motion that could accept varying bar diameters, from ½” and 7/8”, as requested by the client.</li>

                                <p>To ensure robust electrical connections between the Arduino and the peripherals in a high-vibration environment, I designed a custom PCB shield.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>This shield implemented screw terminals, labels, pull-up resistors, reverse polarity protection, and a temperature sensor to detect overheating.</li>
                                    <li>This shield also improved ease of use and cable management for signal-ground pairings, allowing signal pairs to run next to each other.</li>
                                    <li>The first iteration was designed on protoboard, shown above.</li>

                    <p>Working on the Rocketry Team's hybrid rocket engine, I conducted this
                        CFD simulation to investigate different liquid oxidizer injector configurations to supply N2O
                        to our combustion chamber. The goal of this simulation was to investigate desired mass flow, pressure drop, and atomization
                        Into the combustion chamber, completed in ANSYS Fluent.</p>

                            <p>To accelerate simulation time, 2D and 3D models were used. 2D simulations were used to quickly alter geometry and simulate results
