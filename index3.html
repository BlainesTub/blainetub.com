                    <img src="/assets/images/Capstone-1.png" alt="Project 1">
                    <p>For my engineering capstone project at the University of Victoria, my group and I were tasked with
                        designing a custom sanding machine for a local powder coat shop to remove powder coat overspray from steel hanging rods. </p>
                    <div class="project-details">
                        <p>Our client, JS. Foster Corp, is a machine shop that offers powder coating services. To achieve this, they hang parts 
                            on steel rods with hooks, which are then cured in an oven. To ensure adequate paint transfer efficiency, a solid 
                            electrical connection to ground the hanging rods is required. This requirement meant that paint overspray on the rods 
                            needed to be removed by hand, and unpopular task on the shop floor. The hanging rods also have a washer welded on the 
                            ends to prevent them from sliding off the racking.

                            <img src="/assets/images/Capstone-2.png" alt="Project 2">
                            <p>I designed this test jig to verify that the angled idler would convert rotation to axial translation</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>3D printed pillow blocks secure the bearings for the rollers, and a 3D printed adjustable roller assembly allows the angle of the idler to be calibrated. </li>
                                <li>Parallel powered rollers causing the bar to spin, and an angled idler roller applies pressure from above, exerting an axial force to allow translation.</li>
                                <li>The bottom rollers were designed to have a higher hardness rating, to promote slipping along the parallel rollers while gripping the top roller.</li>
                                <li>In this  test jig, the parallel rollers were powered by a cordless drill, and a handheld belt sander simulates the forces from the sander</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This testing jig allowed us to verify the concept, and estimate how much downward force was required from the top roller to facilitate axial 
                                sliding without seizing.

                                <p>This was my final design for the angled idler assembly.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The whole assembly can slide up and down along the two shoulder bolts, which locate the springs, supplying the required downwards force on the bar.</li>
                                    <li>Smooth sliding is ensured by the two brass bushings in the top square bar.</li>
                                    <li>To simplify machining requirements A shoulder bolt is used as the shaft, locating two bearings with 3D printed spacers.</li>

                                <p>To ensure that the angled idler supplies sufficient downwards force to facilitate axial translation, I conducted spring stiffness and pre-tension calculations</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Empirical testing showed that ~15lbs of force was required to facilitate translation.</li>
                                    <li>Spring pre-tension, and buttom-out position were considered, and a spring stiffness and length were selected to supply 15lbs-20lbs for rods over a range of motion that could accept varying bar diameters, from ½” and 7/8”, as requested by the client.</li>

                                <p>To ensure robust electrical connections between the Arduino and the peripherals in a high-vibration environment, I designed a custom PCB shield.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>This shield implemented screw terminals, labels, pull-up resistors, reverse polarity protection, and a temperature sensor to detect overheating.</li>
                                    <li>This shield also improved ease of use and cable management for signal-ground pairings, allowing signal pairs to run next to each other.</li>
                                    <li>The first iteration was designed on protoboard, shown above.</li>
